Project Phase III - Group H (Tablet Monitor)

How to run?
    1. Open TabletMonitor/TabletMonitor.sln in Visual Studio (Community Edition works)
    2. In SolutionExplorer select LogIn.aspx - this is the home page of our website.
    3. From the toolbar click run. Our website was tested using Google Chrome as a browser to run in.

What to do?
    - Loging In: From the log-in page you can log in using an employee ID. Some IDs our database knows about are 0 through 9. To log in as a Supervisor use ID 1 or 7. To log in as a regular employee (team member) use IDs 0, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8 or 9.
     - See the device records: Log in as a Supervisor. You should see a table that shows all device records starting with the most recently checked out devices.
     - Check Out a device: Log in as an employee that is a team member and has not currently checked out a device. You should see a drop-down menu with devices available to be checked out. Select a device and click the check out button. This will lead you to the return page so you can return immediately or log out and return it later.
     - Return a device: Log in as an employee that is a team member and has currently checked out a device. You should see a screen that tells you which device you have currently checked out and button to return it. When you click the button the device will be returned and you will be redirected to the screen for checking out device if you want to check out another device or simply log out.
